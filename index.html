                            <p>Venice is probably the most famous and iconic city in the world, one of the oldest artificial islands ever built. For more than 15 centuries Venice has stood as a testament to construction innovation and technology, but also art, architecture and luxury lifestyle.</p>
                            <p>Venice is more than just a location, itâ€™s a way of life, a unique state of mind, a city with a very delicate balance between water and land, nature and technology, traditional and contemporary art and events.</p>
                            <p>With the Submerged Venice we are proposing and enhancing this way of life. The project is a floating masterplan with a built-up area of 70,000 m2, that includes 20,000 m2 of underwater experience directly open to the ocean. A new way to experience the relationship between man and water.</p>
